# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/splash/
    - assets/images/login/
    - assets/images/tab/
    - assets/images/urine/
    - assets/images/urine/home/
    - assets/images/urine/arrangement/
    - assets/images/urine/bluetooth/
    - assets/images/urine/result/
    - assets/images/urine/history/
    - assets/translations/
    - assets/json/licenses.json
    - assets/json/urine_desc.json
    - assets/json/disease_info.json


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: pretendard
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-SemiBold.ttf
